The setflow function sets the global variable cflow_amounts to the user inputted cash flows.
If no periods are specified the global variable cflow_times is set to correspond with the first cash flow being period 0
(the investment) and each subsequent cash flow being period 1,2,3...etc. If the user has inputted periods these are set to the
global variable cflow_times and a check is preformed to ensure the number of cash flows and periods are equal. The user does not have
to input times/periods in chronological order.

@example To inpute a cash flow that does not start generating income for 5 periods. All periods in-between will be given a cash flow of zero.

/**
Finds a single IRR or root if it exists. An initial bracket is created discounting the cash flows at interest rates of x1 = 0% and x2 = 20%.
If f(x1) and f(x2) do not have opposite signs and the function is decreasing x1 is continually decreased or if the
function is increasing x2 is continually increased until f(x1) and f(x2) bracket zero.

Depending on which of x1 or x2 produce a negative present value that variable is equated to a new variable rtb.
A change dx (change in interest rate) which starts off as x2 - x1 if the function is increasing or x1 - x2 if the
function is decreasing is added to rtb to create x_mid (x_mid = dx + rtb). To find a root, the present value is first
calculated at the x_mid. If the present value is negative, rtb is adjusted to the x_mid. If the present value is positive
rtb does not change. The dx value is then halved and added again to rtb to create a new x_mid. 

The present value is again calculated and the process repeated until the present value or the dx value is less than the accuracy of 1.0e-6.
If the maximum number of iterations is reached 500, returns error.

Comparing Equation 1 and Equation 2 the IRRs can be found as follows:
