/**
Calculate the present value of cash flows using discrete compounding. For discounting at discrete intervals for example, annually, semiannually. 

$$PV = FV0 + FV1/(1+r) + FV2/(1+r)^2 + ... + FVn/(1+r)^n$$

Where r is the interest rate and n is the number of periods.  

@param r Interest rate at which to discount future value of cash flows
@returns Present value of cash flows using discrete compounding
